#Overview of School District Analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to identify cheating conducted by the ninth graders of Thomas High School. School officals believe that it occured in the reading and math departments. We have been contracted to confirm or deny these acquisitions for them.

#Results
We have found minimal changes after excluding the reading and math score of Thomas High School ninth graders.
Here is a picture of scores with everyone included 

vs. the second time we completed the analysis without the reading and math score of Thomas High School ninth graders.
